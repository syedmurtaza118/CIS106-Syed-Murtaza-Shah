# CIS106-Syed-Murtaza-Shah
Hello, My name is Syed Murtaza Shah. I am a second year student at Harper College and hope to transfer to UIUC by Fall 2021. I am pursuing a career in business Marketing/Managment
and hope to get a Bachelors of Arts in Business. In my effort to become a diverse and versatile individual, I have taken this computer programming class to see if it interests me 
and/or if I can make this part of my career. This class was recommended among others and I chose this to hopefully get a feel for coding and be introduced to the IT world and learn
more about it. I am a beginner with absolute zero experience in coding and hopefully this class is not too hard for me and I can learn about the class while also doing well in it.
